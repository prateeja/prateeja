1. **[Performance Problem](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#performance-vs-scalability)** - If you have a performance problem, your system is slow for a single user.
2. **[Scalability Problem](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#performance-vs-scalability)** - If you have a scalability problem, your system is fast for a single user but slow under heavy load.
3. **[Latency](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#latency-vs-throughput)** - Latency is the time to perform some action or to produce some result.
4. **[Throughput](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#latency-vs-throughput)** - Throughput is the number of such actions or results per unit of time.
5. **[Consistency](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#cap-theorem)** - Every read receives the most recent write or an error
6. **[Availability](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#cap-theorem)** - Every request receives a response, without guarantee that it contains the most recent version of the information
7. **[Partition Tolerance](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#cap-theorem)** - The system continues to operate despite arbitrary partitioning due to network failures
8. **[Weak consistency](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#consistency-patterns)** - After a write, reads may or may not see it. A best effort approach is taken. This approach is seen in systems such as memcached. Weak consistency works well in real time use cases such as VoIP, video chat, and realtime multiplayer games. For example, if you are on a phone call and lose reception for a few seconds, when you regain connection you do not hear what was spoken during connection loss.
9. **[Eventual consistency](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#consistency-patterns)** - After a write, reads will eventually see it (typically within milliseconds). Data is replicated asynchronously. This approach is seen in systems such as DNS and email. Eventual consistency works well in highly available systems.
10. **[Strong consistency](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#consistency-patterns)** - After a write, reads will see it. Data is replicated synchronously. This approach is seen in file systems and RDBMSes. Strong consistency works well in systems that need transactions.
11. **[Fail-over (Active-passive)](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#availability-patterns)** - With active-passive fail-over, heartbeats are sent between the active and the passive server on standby. If the heartbeat is interrupted, the passive server takes over the active's IP address and resumes service. The length of downtime is determined by whether the passive server is already running in 'hot' standby or whether it needs to start up from 'cold' standby. Only the active server handles traffic. Active-passive failover can also be referred to as master-slave failover.
12. **[Fail-over (Active-active)](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#availability-patterns)** - In active-active, both servers are managing traffic, spreading the load between them. If the servers are public-facing, the DNS would need to know about the public IPs of both servers. If the servers are internal-facing, application logic would need to know about both servers. Active-active failover can also be referred to as master-master failover.
13. **[DNS - Domain name system](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#domain-name-system)** - A Domain Name System (DNS) translates a domain name such as www.example.com to an IP address. DNS is hierarchical, with a few authoritative servers at the top level. Your router or ISP provides information about which DNS server(s) to contact when doing a lookup. Lower level DNS servers cache mappings, which could become stale due to DNS propagation delays. DNS results can also be cached by your browser or OS for a certain period of time, determined by the time to live (TTL). 
14. **[CDN - Content delivery network](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#content-delivery-network)** - A content delivery network (CDN) is a globally distributed network of proxy servers, serving content from locations closer to the user. Generally, static files such as HTML/CSS/JS, photos, and videos are served from CDN, although some CDNs such as Amazon's CloudFront support dynamic content. The site's DNS resolution will tell clients which server to contact. Serving content from CDNs can significantly improve performance in two ways:
    1. Users receive content from data centers close to them
    2. Your servers do not have to serve requests that the CDN fulfills
    3. 2 types of CDN exists [Push CDNs](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#push-cdns) & [Pull CDNs](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#pull-cdns)
15. **[Load balancer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#load-balancer)** - Load balancers distribute incoming client requests to computing resources such as application servers and databases. In each case, the load balancer returns the response from the computing resource to the appropriate client. Load balancers are effective at:
    1. Preventing requests from going to unhealthy servers
    2. Preventing overloading resources
    3. Helping to eliminate a single point of failure
    
    Load balancers can be implemented with hardware (expensive) or with software such as HAProxy. 
16. **[Reverse proxy (web server)](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#reverse-proxy-web-server)** - A reverse proxy is a web server that centralizes internal services and provides unified interfaces to the public. Requests from clients are forwarded to a server that can fulfill it before the reverse proxy returns the server's response to the client. With additional benefits like Increased security, Increased scalability and flexibility, SSL termination, Compression, Caching, Static content etc. 
17. **[ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#database)** - ACID is a set of properties of relational database transactions.
    1. **Atomicity** - Each transaction is all or nothing
    2. **Consistency** - Any transaction will bring the database from one valid state to another
    3. **Isolation** - Executing transactions concurrently has the same results as if the transactions were executed serially
    4. **Durability** - Once a transaction has been committed, it will remain so
    
    There are many techniques to scale a relational database: master-slave replication, master-master replication, federation, sharding, denormalization, and SQL tuning. 
18. **[Sharding](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#sharding)** - Sharding distributes data across different databases such that each database can only manage a subset of the data. Taking a users database as an example, as the number of users increases, more shards are added to the cluster.
19. **[Cache](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#cache)** - Caching improves page load times and can reduce the load on your servers and databases. In this model, the dispatcher will first lookup if the request has been made before and try to find the previous result to return, in order to save the actual execution. Databases often benefit from a uniform distribution of reads and writes across its partitions. Popular items can skew the distribution, causing bottlenecks. Putting a cache in front of a database can help absorb uneven loads and spikes in traffic. 
20. **[Asynchronism](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#asynchronism)** - Asynchronous workflows help reduce request times for expensive operations that would otherwise be performed in-line. They can also help by doing time-consuming work in advance, such as periodic aggregation of data. 
21. **[Hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP)](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#hypertext-transfer-protocol-http)** - HTTP is a method for encoding and transporting data between a client and a server. It is a request/response protocol: clients issue requests and servers issue responses with relevant content and completion status info about the request. HTTP is self-contained, allowing requests and responses to flow through many intermediate routers and servers that perform load balancing, caching, encryption, and compression. 
22. **[Transmission control protocol (TCP)](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#transmission-control-protocol-tcp)** - TCP is a connection-oriented protocol over an IP network. Connection is established and terminated using a handshake. All packets sent are guaranteed to reach the destination in the original order and without corruption through:
    1. Sequence numbers and checksum fields for each packet
    2. Acknowledgement packets and automatic retransmission
 
    If the sender does not receive a correct response, it will resend the packets. If there are multiple timeouts, the connection is dropped. TCP also implements flow control and congestion control. These guarantees cause delays and generally result in less efficient transmission than UDP.
23. **[User datagram protocol (UDP)](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#user-datagram-protocol-udp)** - UDP is connectionless. Datagrams (analogous to packets) are guaranteed only at the datagram level. Datagrams might reach their destination out of order or not at all. UDP does not support congestion control. Without the guarantees that TCP support, UDP is generally more efficient. 
24. **[Remote procedure call (RPC)](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#remote-procedure-call-rpc)** - In an RPC, a client causes a procedure to execute on a different address space, usually a remote server. The procedure is coded as if it were a local procedure call, abstracting away the details of how to communicate with the server from the client program. Remote calls are usually slower and less reliable than local calls so it is helpful to distinguish RPC calls from local calls. Popular RPC frameworks include Protobuf, Thrift, and Avro. 
25. **[Representational state transfer (REST)](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#representational-state-transfer-rest)** - REST is an architectural style enforcing a client/server model where the client acts on a set of resources managed by the server. The server provides a representation of resources and actions that can either manipulate or get a new representation of resources. All communication must be stateless and cacheable.
